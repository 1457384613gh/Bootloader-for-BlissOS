Dear Smith,

--I am very happy to receive your letter.
--I have tried these [EFI video driver]-s. [efi_video.zip](https://github.com/dakanji/RefindPlus/files/10474713/efi_video.zip)
 - [CsmVideoDxe.efi] is from Clover;
 - [BiosVideo.efi] is from OpenCore.

They are designed for [Ironlake/Arrandale].
They cannot work for rEFInd, or I don't know how to make them work for rEFInd.

My GPU is Arrandale

I don't know where can I find an [EFI video driver] for rEFInd. Is there an external [IntelGopDriver.efi] for rEFInd? Where can I get it?

--If you don't know, could you unpack [CsmVideoDxe.efi] and adapt it for rEFInd on [Ironlake/Arrandale]? Clover is a fork of rEFInd so there is a little hope.

--I will appreciate it if you can give a reply.

---------Sincerely yours,

-------------Users
