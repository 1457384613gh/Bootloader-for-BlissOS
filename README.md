# Bootloader for BlissOS
### The README.md is being written

This project is for testing.

Please use [GPT+UEFI], NOT [MBR+ESP].

Download it from [Releases](https://github.com/1457384613gh/Bootloader-for-BlissOS/releases)!

If it is critical, I will delete it.

It is based on rEFInd Boot Manager.

You can preview .vhdx by using Hyper-V.

All details around how to set are written into .conf files.

README.MD is to be updated, in the future.
